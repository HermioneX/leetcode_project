'''
Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0). Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves back to the original place.
The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character. The valid robot moves are R (Right), L(Left), U (Up) and D (down). The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.
Example 1:
Input: "UD"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: "LL"
Output: false
